# 🤖 Hugging Face AI Integration Setup

## Quick Setup Guide

### Step 1: Get Your API Token
1. Go to [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/) and sign up/login
2. Click your profile → **Settings** → **Access Tokens**
3. Click **New token** → Choose **Read** permissions
4. Copy your token (starts with `hf_...`)

### Step 2: Configure Your App
1. Open `src/services/aiMatcher.js`
2. Find line 3: `const HF_API_TOKEN = 'your_hf_token'`
3. Replace `'your_hf_token'` with your actual token:
   ```javascript
   const HF_API_TOKEN = 'hf_your_actual_token_here'
   ```

### Step 3: Test the Enhancement
1. Restart your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Upload a resume and search for jobs
3. Look for the **"AI Enhanced"** badge on job cards
4. Check browser console for: `🤖 Using Hugging Face AI for advanced matching...`

## What You Get with AI Enhancement

### 🧠 **Semantic Matching**
- **Before**: Simple keyword matching
- **After**: Deep understanding of context and meaning
- **Example**: "React developer" matches with "Frontend engineer with component experience"

### 🎯 **Smarter Scoring**
- **Before**: Basic skill counting
- **After**: Cosine similarity between resume and job embeddings
- **Result**: More accurate match percentages

### 🔍 **Advanced Skill Extraction**
- **Before**: Predefined skill keywords
- **After**: AI-powered Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- **Benefit**: Discovers skills you might have missed

### 💡 **Intelligent Tips**
- **Before**: Generic advice
- **After**: AI-generated insights based on semantic similarity
- **Examples**: 
  - "🎯 Excellent match! Highlight your relevant experience prominently"
  - "🔧 Priority skill to learn: Docker"

## Models Used

1. **Sentence Transformers** (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
   - Converts text to numerical vectors
   - Enables semantic similarity comparison

2. **Named Entity Recognition** (`bert-large-cased-finetuned-conll03-english`)
   - Extracts skills and entities from job descriptions
   - More accurate than keyword matching

## Fallback System

- ✅ **No API token**: Uses smart keyword matching
- ✅ **API errors**: Gracefully falls back to simple matching
- ✅ **Rate limits**: Continues working with cached results
- ✅ **Network issues**: Never breaks the user experience

## Cost & Limits

- **Free tier**: 1,000 requests per month
- **Rate limit**: ~1 request per second
- **Cost**: Free for most users, $9/month for heavy usage

## Troubleshooting

### "AI Enhanced" badge not showing?
- Check your API token is correct
- Look for console errors
- Verify internet connection

### Slow matching?
- Normal for first request (model loading)
- Subsequent requests are faster
- Consider upgrading to paid tier for faster inference

### API errors?
- App continues working with fallback matching
- Check Hugging Face status page
- Verify token permissions

**Your app works great without Hugging Face, but becomes incredibly smart with it! 🚀**
