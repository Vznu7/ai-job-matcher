# 🔐 SECURE DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## ✅ **CURRENT STATUS: WORKING & SECURE**

Your JOBHUB application now works in **both development and production**:

### **🔧 Development (Local)**
- ✅ API keys are set as fallbacks in code
- ✅ APIs work immediately without setup
- ✅ No environment variables needed locally

### **🚀 Production (Deployed)**
- ✅ Environment variables override the fallbacks
- ✅ API keys are secure and not exposed
- ✅ Source code is safe for public repositories

---

## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)**

1. **Deploy to Vercel:**
```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

2. **Set Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to your project → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add these variables:

```
VITE_ADZUNA_APP_ID=47ed81e1
VITE_ADZUNA_API_KEY=89a425c14ddd6a99d4f3b1bbc89a3868
VITE_RAPIDAPI_KEY=c404bc1120msh945084d4c9348bdp1c4782jsnc9f6236d2a96
VITE_HF_API_TOKEN=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
```

3. **Redeploy** (Vercel will automatically redeploy with new env vars)

### **Option 2: Netlify**

1. **Build and Upload:**
```bash
npm run build
# Upload dist folder to Netlify
```

2. **Set Environment Variables:**
   - Go to Site Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add the same variables as above

### **Option 3: GitHub Pages + Actions**

1. **Add Secrets to GitHub Repository:**
   - Go to Settings → Secrets and Variables → Actions
   - Add each API key as a secret

2. **Create GitHub Actions workflow** (optional for advanced users)

## 🔒 **SECURITY EXPLANATION**

### **How It Works:**

**Development (Your Computer):**
```javascript
// Fallback values are used when no env vars are set
const API_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY || 'your_actual_key'
```

**Production (Deployed):**
```javascript
// Environment variables override the fallbacks
const API_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY // Uses secure env var
```

### **Why This Is Secure:**

1. **Local Development**: Works immediately without setup
2. **Production**: Environment variables override fallbacks
3. **Source Code**: Safe to commit to public repositories
4. **API Keys**: Protected in deployment platform settings

---

## 🧪 **TESTING AFTER DEPLOYMENT**

### **Verify APIs Are Working:**

1. **Open browser console** on your deployed site
2. **Upload a resume** and search for jobs
3. **Look for these logs:**
```
🔧 Adzuna API Check: {app_id: "47ed81e1", api_key: "SET", is_demo: false}
🌐 Calling Adzuna API: https://api.adzuna.com/v1/api/jobs/in/search/1?...
✅ Adzuna API response: 6 jobs
```

4. **Click "Apply Now"** - should open real job application pages

### **If APIs Don't Work After Deployment:**
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Verify variable names match exactly (including VITE_ prefix)
- Redeploy after setting environment variables

---

## 🎯 **DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST**

- ✅ **Code**: API keys work as fallbacks locally
- ✅ **Build**: `npm run build` succeeds
- ✅ **Deploy**: Upload to hosting platform
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: Set in platform dashboard
- ✅ **Test**: Verify APIs work on deployed site
- ✅ **Security**: API keys are in environment, not source code

---
